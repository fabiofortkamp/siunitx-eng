# siunitx-eng

A configuration file for the [siunitx](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) package, consisting of some default options and common unit names for engineering documents.

## Instalation

Run latex on the `siunitx-eng.dtx` file, to generate all files in this project (including this README). The resulting file `siunitx.cfg`  must be placed in your local texmf tree (search the help for your TeX distribution on how to do this). Personally, I place it under `tex/latex/local`.
